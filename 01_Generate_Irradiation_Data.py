"""
This scripts computes the direct normal radiation (DNI) incident on a north-south tracking collector and the incident 
total radiation on a titled surface. 

The input data is the typical meteorological year (TMY) from EnergyPlus, read as an epw file.

The script makes use of the following libraries: 
- pyepw for to ready the typical meteorological year data
- pvlib to compute the incident irradiation

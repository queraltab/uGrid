# uGrid

uGrid is an open source code engineering design and decision tool developed to aid the engineering,
procurement and construction (EPC) of sustainable, reliable microgrids relying on a combination of
solar and backup (fossil fueled) generator energy sources. By introducing technical and economic
optimization and integrating many of the major EPC decisions, uGrid can speed up and improve a
prospective microgrid project or program, as well indicate which financial conditions (cost of capital) and tariff can drive the project in the market.
